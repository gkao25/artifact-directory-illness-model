Title:
ILLNESS, An Alternative Way To Assess Wildfire Risk

Abstract:
Currently, SDG&E employs Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) as a preventive measure to mitigate wildfire risks. The decision to activate a PSPS is primarily based on windspeed thresholds, which can sometimes be overly simplistic, resulting in unnecessary power disruptions. Given the complexity of wildfire risks, which are influenced by a range of environmental and social factors, there is a need for a more comprehensive, data-driven approach to PSPS decision-making. 
Our project introduces the ILLNESS Score — Insight on Life, Living, Nature, Energy, Service, and Season — a multi-factor machine learning model designed to enhance the accuracy of PSPS decisions. By integrating environmental, infrastructure, and community factors, this approach provides a more holistic and data-driven risk assessment, reducing unnecessary power shutoffs while maintaining fire prevention effectiveness.
